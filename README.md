# sig-appdev-firebase
An example project to check your work! What I want from you

Only use this repo if you are stuck! It's best to learn by just trying to get through this.

I want you to make a messaging app that uses network calls to firebase

- Allows users to input text that is pushed to a firebase realtime database
- outputs text in chronological order that is stored in the firebase database
- uses full MVVM architecture
- One extra fun feature!
